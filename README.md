🎓 Student Performance Analysis
📘 Overview
This project dives into student performance data to explore how different factors like gender, parental education, lunch type, and test preparation impact academic scores in Math, Reading, and Writing.

The goal is to find meaningful patterns that could help educators, parents, and students better understand what influences academic success.

🧠 Key Questions
Which factor affects student performance the most?
Do test preparation courses actually help?
Is there a performance gap between male and female students?
Does parental education have any effect on scores?
Are math, reading, and writing scores strongly correlated?
